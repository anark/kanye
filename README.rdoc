A utility that helps you download all of your favorite tracks from your favorite music blog aggregator.

This will output options to <tt>~/.kanye_rc</tt>. Your downloads will now begin.

Now that you've configured it, just run +kanye+ any time to go over your latest favorites.

== iTunes integration

By adding the following to your <tt>~/.kanye_rc</tt> file, Kanye will add tracks to your iTunes library and add them to a playlist named for the current month and year (ie."June 2011")

    playlist: true

To change the playlist naming edit the playlist_template line in your <tt>~/.kanye_rc</tt> file.  The following example will add your songs to a playlist titled kanye followed by the current year (ie. "kanye 2011")
